                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>Mission Ready HQ gave me work experience while learning more about a technical job, learning how to develop apps and javascript. I was also getting work experience working for Crunch which gave me a bit of direction in what to study. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="column col_col">
                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>we can say that MERN Stack has bright future ahead. In order to get started with MERN Stack development, all you really need is a good understanding of JavaScript and ES6 Fundamentals, but also at least some familiarity with the basic concepts of React and Node js.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="column col_gro">
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>In the coming years, MERN Stack is highly likely to be used extensively since more and more applications are now built-in JavaScript. It is the most sought-after language that serves both the front-end and the back-end side.</p>
